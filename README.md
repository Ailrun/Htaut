## Description ##

TBA

## Current Support ##

- Basics are defined.
- You can add more type as instance of type class `Prop`
- If you want, you can prove new theorems one by one with `exfalso`. (but it will terrible since you must bother proving from the basic lemmas.)

## TODO ##

- Support (more) lemmas (Will support all tautologic lemmas in Benson Mates' _Elementary Logic_).
- Support keywords for (more) efficient proving.

## Future Work ##

- Add qualitifiers
- Add automatic proving tools
